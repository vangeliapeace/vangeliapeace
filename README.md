<h3> ✨ Hi, I’m Vangelia Peace Palijama. ✨ </h3>

<b> Get to know me: </b>
- 🌱 I’m currently majoring Computer Science Program (est. 2019) at BINUS University.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning things related to Artificial Intelligence and Design. It's fun!
- 👩🏻‍💻 Until now, I've been friends with C/C++, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Java programming language.

<b> Wait, there's more! </b>
- 🤩 Aside of being a programming student, I really love to write, read and watch movies. They are the best for healing.

- 📚 High curiosity makes me love learning new things, having a lot of knowledge gives me the best feeling.
<br>
I'm not the best, but I am always willing to be a great, well-mannered and impactful person in the future; <br>
to be the best version of myself.

"Dream, pray, believe, work hard, and make it happen."
